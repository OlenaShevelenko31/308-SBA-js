This application is be a data processing script designed to handle information related to courses, assignment groups, learner submissions, and their analysis. The primary goal is to calculate the weighted average score for learners based on their submissions, considering the points possible for each assignment.

Here's an overview of how the application works:

Input Data: The script receives data in the form of CourseInfo, AssignmentGroup, and an array of LearnerSubmission objects.
Data Validation: The script validates the input data to ensure consistency. For example, it checks if AssignmentGroups belong to the correct courses by comparing their course_ids.
Processing Learner Submissions: It processes learner submissions, calculating their scores for each assignment. If submissions are late, it deducts 10% of the total points possible from their scores.
Weighted Average Calculation: Using the calculated scores, it computes the weighted average for each learner. Assignments with more points_possible are given more weight in the average calculation.
Output Formatting: Finally, the script formats the results into an array of objects containing learner IDs, their weighted averages, and individual assignment scores.
Error Handling: The application handles potential errors gracefully, such as division by zero (if points_possible is 0) or unexpected data types.
Function Definition: All of these functionalities are encapsulated within a function named getLearnerData() which takes the necessary parameters and returns the formatted result.
Overall, the application is designed to efficiently process and analyze learner data, providing valuable insights into their performance in courses and assignments.
